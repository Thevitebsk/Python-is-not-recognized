This is basicly an interpriter for ['Python' is not recognized](https://esolangs.org/wiki/%27Python%27_is_not_recognized). (A variant of ['Python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.](https://esolangs.org/wiki/%27Python%27_is_not_recognized_as_an_internal_or_external_command,_operable_program_or_batch_file.))

# Syntax
You can store data IN a line, so for example:
```
0:t1;    || 0=any
1:helo   || 1"=helo" *since it will never be executed
```
got that?
